There are many online tutorials and courses devoted to teaching people how to program in webpages using HTML, CSS,
and Javascript. Before these can be useful a person must understand certain basic concepts, such as how to save an HTML file on a Windows computer, and how to manage folders and files.

This website is intended to bridge that gap, while also introducing users to advanced topics such as Git and Linux development and hosting platforms.
