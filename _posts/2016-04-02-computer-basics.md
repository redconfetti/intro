## The Value of Computers

When people think of what computers can do for them they often think of the power of the Internet,
which provides an abundance of information on the World Wide Web, as well as the ability to
communicate with anyone in the world in many different ways. Additionally computers are valued
highly because they allow us to view digital photos, listen to music, play games, and watch videos.

To people to that own businesses, computers are like tools that enable their employees to do work
faster, and with results that are higher quality. Computers are perfect for solving problems that
are very complicated, and require accuracy.

For example, businesses used to write down information about their finances using very large sheets
of paper called spread-sheets. To calculate totals based on this information required lots of work.
If many pieces of information changed in the spreadsheet, it would require the same amount of work
to re-calculate the totals. Today, there are spreadsheet programs that can be configured to
automatically perform those calculations, even immediately after changes are made to an existing
spreadsheet. Prior to the late 1970s, computers were very large and very expensive. When computer
manufacturers started to sell smaller more afforable "personal" computers, businesses were
purchasing them primarily so that their employees could use
[spreadsheet software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet).

## With Great Power Comes Greater Complexity

When most people think of "computers", they think of desktop or notebook computers (laptops). Cell
phones and tablets are also computers, but they are not as powerful because they are designed to be
easy to use.

When any machine provides a set of controls that are used by a human being to control the machine,
this set of controls is known as the
[user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) (UI). Keyboards, mice, and touch
screens are examples of user interfaces that are commonly used with computers. Additionally, the
controls that are provided on a screen, such as buttons that you can click on with a mouse, are
also considered part of the user interface. When companies create websites or computer programs
(also known as computer applications), they will often hire people that have studied principles for
designing good user interfaces.

The more simple that a user interface is, the simpler it is for people to learn how to use the 
application. The tradeoff of a simple user interface is that the application is not as powerful as a
more complicated application.

For example, the application used by most professionals for modifying images is
[Adobe Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop). This program has so many options
for editing images that it can be very overwhelming to new users. The difficulty in learning how to
use this program is harder than learning to use the
[Microsoft Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_(software)) program that comes bundled with
Microsoft Windows, however Photoshop allows you to do much more, and get the exact results that
you are working towards.

Although it is possible for people to create content using cell phones or tablet computers, these
devices are not designed for professional content creation. An author writing a book would
not prefer to use a touch screen keyboard on cell phone. They can write a book much better on an
actual keyboard.

Desktop and notebook computers can be used to create music, videos, video games, and web pages. You
can also develop cell phone applications using a desktop computer, but you cannot develop cell
phone applications using a cell phone.

Although you will have to learn the concepts needed to use a computer application that is designed
for a specific profession, a basic understanding of computers will help you succeed in any
profession that uses computers. It can help you solve problems faster, and work with greater 
confidence than people who do not understand how computers are designed and why.

That the more you understand about computers, the less likely you will be
confused, and the more confident you will become in using them. The more you learn, the more
powerful you will be in using them.

## What is a Computer?

Even though people associate the devices described above as "computers", a computer is actually any
device that can be provided with instructions to compute the result a problem. The instructions
provided to the computer will include certain data, as well as the operations that must be performed
with that data. The instructions might involve simple or advanced mathematical processing, as well
as logical processing.

A computer is a device that takes instructions and data as input, performs some sort of computation,
and then provides the result as output. By this definition, there are devices that were invented and
used even in ancient times that can be considered a "computer". These are early examples of
[analog computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer) that were at first mechanical
machines, and later introduced electrical components to solve problems.

If a problem required following instructions involving math and logic, with the problem being very
complex, and needed to be solved quickly and accurately, a computer was needed. A human being might
make mistakes and solve the problem too slowly. For instance, a
[gun data computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_data_computer) was developed during
World War 2 to calculate where to aim a gun so that it hits it's target. The calculation included
information such as where the target currently is, which direction they are moving, which direction
and how strong the wind is blowing, etc.

If you think about all machines that have ever been created, they typically have been designed to
solve a single specific problem. But the power of computers is that they are designed to be fed
instructions, any instructions, and thus they can solve any problem. When computers are combined
with other devices like monitors, speakers, or even robotic arms, the possibilities of what you can
make the computer system do are almost infinite.

## The Von Neumann Architecture

</div>

The first digital computer was created in 1945, known as the
[ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer). Much
like the gun data computer mentioned above, it was designed to calculate information related to
firing artillery. The ENIAC was 1000 times faster than previous electro-mechanical machines.

The mathematician and physicist [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann)
was working on the [hydrogen bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb) when he heard about
the ENIAC, and was the first to run a computational problem on the ENIAC related to the hydrogen
bomb instead of for artillery firing data.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

In 1945 John von Neumann described a [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) that is similar to that still used today. A device known as the
[Central Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU) includes a
unit that is responsible for performing the math and logic calculations, as well as a unit that is
used to control each instruction that is being processed.

The control unit includes a mechanism that determines the
[clock rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate)of the CPU, which is the number of
instructions that the CPU performs per a second. This rate is expressed using
[Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz), which represent the number of cycles per each second.
The ENIAC used a 100 kilo Hertz (kHz) clock, which means that it was able to perform 100,000
instructions per each second.

In March of 1993 a CPU called the Penium P5 was released by Intel for personal computers was able to
perform at 60 Mega Hertz (MHz). This means it was able to perform 60,000,000 instructions per each
second. In January of 2010, Intel released the Core i5-650 processor which has a clock speed of 3.2
Giga Hertz (GHz), or 3,200,000,000 instructions per each second.

## Memory

In the above diagram of the Von Neumann architecture, you see 'memory unit' connected to the CPU.
The memory unit is where the instructions for the problem are written before the CPU starts to
perform the calculations. The memory unit also stores any information that is related to the
instructions. The memory unit must be able provide and store information very fastly, or else it
will slow down the CPU. The memory does not retain any information when the computer is turned off.

A good analogy is to think of the CPU as the brain of the computer that is solving the problems,
and the memory is like a chalk board that a person might write down a complex math problem while
they solve it.

In modern computers the memory is called
[Random Access Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) (RAM). When you buy a
computer it comes with a certain amount of RAM, but you can usually buy more RAM chips that can be
installed inside of the computer so that it can run better. If you are running lots of programs on
your computer at the same time, or running programs that use a lot of memory, this is a good idea.

## Input / Output

As you can see in the above diagram, on the left and right there are the 'Input Device' and
'Output Device'. Sometimes this is represented by the computer using the abbreviation "I/O". These
can be any number of devices that are part of the computer system, or connected to the computer.
For example, a hard drive is both an Input and Output device. A hard drive is able to provide
information, or store new information. Unlike the memory, the hard drive will continue to store
information even when the computer system is turned off.
